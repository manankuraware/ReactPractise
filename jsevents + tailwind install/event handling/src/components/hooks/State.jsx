// Yes, you can use normal JavaScript (e.g., document.getElementById().innerHTML = ...) in a React app to update the DOM, but you absolutely should not do it unless there is a very specific reason. Letâ€™s break it down:

// React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently manage UI updates. Direct DOM manipulation breaks this abstraction.

// React won't know the DOM was changed, and you may see unexpected behavior (e.g., updates getting overridden or ignored).

// It makes code harder to maintain, harder to debug, and less predictable.
